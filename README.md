# codechef
CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming, and programming contests. It hosts three featured contests every month (Long Challenge, CookOff, LunchTime & Starters) and gives away prizes and goodies to the winners as encouragement.
